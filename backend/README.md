# Backend Project README
## Project Overview

The "blog-app-sushant" project serves as the backend component of a web application. It is responsible for handling server-side logic, APIs, and data management. The project utilizes modern backend technologies to ensure smooth operation and security.

## Scripts

The following scripts are available to facilitate development, build, and execution processes:

- **build**: Compile TypeScript files using the TypeScript compiler.
- **start**: Start the backend server after it's been built.
- **dev**: Run TypeScript compilation in watch mode and start the server using Nodemon concurrently.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the project dependencies using `npm install or yarn`.
3. Set up your environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the root directory(see env example).
   You need to have postgresql installed on your machine cz this app uses postgresql as Db.
4. Run the development server using `npm run dev or yarn dev`.
5. Access the backend APIs at the specified address.
